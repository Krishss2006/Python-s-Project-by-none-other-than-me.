## Number to Words Converter

```python
def number_to_words(num):
    ones = ["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine"]
    teens = ["", "eleven", "twelve", "thirteen", "fourteen", "fifteen", "sixteen", "seventeen", "eighteen", "nineteen"]
    tens = ["", "ten", "twenty", "thirty", "forty", "fifty", "sixty", "seventy", "eighty", "ninety"]

    if 0 <= num <= 9:
        print(num)
        return ones[num]
    elif 11 <= num <= 19:
        return teens[num - 10]
    elif 21 <= num <= 99:
        return tens[num // 10] + (" " + ones[num % 10] if num % 10 != 0 else "")
    elif num == 10:
        return tens[1]
    else:
        return "Number out of range"

# Example usage
user_input = int(input("Enter a number: "))
result = number_to_words(user_input)
print(result)
